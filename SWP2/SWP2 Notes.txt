Most likely we are taking non-metric approach. We should give it a good explanation

Proposition: Maybe Include some comparison by gender

P1:
	1) How we prepared data and what is it about? ??Methodolgy (1)
	2) Euclidean distances between the 10 chocolate bars  (1)
	3) Report the similarity matrices in the appendix (Find out more)(0)
	4) 2-dimensional perceptual map based on the Multidimensional Scaling Method (1)
	5) Explain your estimation approach https://www.simfit.org.uk/metric_and_non-metric_scaling.pdf (1)

P2: 
	1) Find out which is better Factor Analysis or Principal component analysis (0)
	2)
